/*
* Channels
* - Writing code with a shared mutable state is quite difficult and error-prone (like in the solution using callbacks).
* - A simpler way is to share information by communication rather than by using a common mutable state. Coroutines can communicate with each other through channels.
* - Channels are communication primitives that allow data to be passed between coroutines.
* - One coroutine can send some information to a channel, while another can receive that information from it:
* Channels work with producer and consumer pattern
* Producer: Produces the value and send to channel (Can be one or more)
* Consumer: Consume the value from channel (Can be one or more)
* Multiple channel handling:
* - When many coroutines receive information from same channel, each element handled only once by one consumer,  Once an element is handled, it is immediately removed from the channel.
* - Channels are like a queue or collections where elements are added on one end and removed from other, but channels are suspendable with send and receive.
* - Channel is represented by three different interfaces: SendChannel, ReceiveChannel, and Channel, with the latter extending the first two.
* - You usually create a channel and give it to producers as a SendChannel instance so that only they can send information to the channel. You give a channel to consumers as a ReceiveChannel instance so that only they can receive from it. Both send and receive methods are declared as suspend:
* Types of channels:
* 1. Unlimited Channels (An unlimited channel is the closest analog to a queue: producers can send elements to this channel and it will keep growing indefinitely. The send() call will never be suspended. If the program runs out of memory, you'll get an OutOfMemoryException. The difference between an unlimited channel and a queue is that when a consumer tries to receive from an empty channel, it becomes suspended until some new elements are sent.)
* 2. Buffered Channels (The size of a buffered channel is constrained by the specified number. Producers can send elements to this channel until the size limit is reached. All of the elements are internally stored. When the channel is full, the next `send` call on it is suspended until more free space becomes available.)
* 3. Rendezvous Channels (The "Rendezvous" channel is a channel without a buffer, the same as a buffered channel with zero size. One of the functions (send() or receive()) is always suspended until the other is called.)
* 4. Conflated Channel (A new element sent to the conflated channel will overwrite the previously sent element, so the receiver will always get only the latest element. The send() call is never suspended.)
